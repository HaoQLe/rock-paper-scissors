# rock-paper-scissors

This project is a simple interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game that users can play against the computer. The game is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The purpose of this project was for me to get experience using eventListeners to interact with the webpage and calling DOM methods to manipulate elements from the DOM.
